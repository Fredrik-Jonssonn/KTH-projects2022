# Priority queue

### Python queue data structure with priority functionality.

A priority queue is an extension of the queue data structure where all elements are placed in and removed from the queue
according to a given priority value.

### Documentation
Documentation for the module is available in the file [prio_queue.py](prio_queue.py)

### Roadmap
* The API of this library is frozen.
* Version numbers adhere to semantic versioning.

The only reason the API of this module will be modified is to solve issues that cannot be solved 
otherwise.
